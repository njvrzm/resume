## Employment

### SellerEngine Software - 2004 to present

Industry-leading producer of software for Amazon sellers; long-time eaters of own dogfood.

#### Senior engineer: 2015 - present

* Designed and initiated a plan for incremental migration to Python 3, dealing with broad dependency upgrades first. Negotiated with engineering and business development teams to achieve buy-in and secure resources enabling a timeline all teams could work with.
* Integrated FedEx, UPS and USPS APIs into our in-house fulfillment system for automatic flagging of problem shipments needing customer support.
* While investigating our transaction handling code for possible refactoring, uncovered a subtle but potentially devastating bug that eventually proved to be responsible for the scattered but disturbing cases of "impossible" database state we'd been observing for years.
* Designed and implemented a major new repricing feature for our flagship product (see next section for details), allowing it to automatically respond to competitor's pricing strategies over time.
* Rebuilt the invoicing system for this product, improving reliability and readability and increasing test coverage. In the process, uncovered and fixed several long-standing bugs.
* Ran a project to merge eight git repositories with partially overlapping file structure while preserving history and commit order.

#### Engineering, architecture, database administration - 2010 to 2015

* Worked with core team to architect a new flagship product, Sellery, a highly configurable repricing and inventory management system, leveraging our existing codebase.
* Acted as primary liaison between support team and development team, striving to ensure that the dev team understood customer needs and confusions and the support team understood technical aspects of feature timelines, blockers, and necessary downtime.

#### Ops transitioning to software development - 2004 to 2009

* Turned a critical business process that relied on a single SQL query taking two to three weeks into a distributed system using a custom-built lightweight database.
* Over the course of two years, improved the efficiency of this system by over a thousand times, handling ten times the throughput in in less than one hundredth the time, while constantly adding new features and adapting to changes in our upstream data sources.
* Managed an ever-growing network of desktop and server machines, then hired, trained and managed my replacement for that role.

#### Sandwich mastery - 2007 to present

Built thousands of sandwiches. Enjoyed them.
