## Employment

### SellerEngine Software - 2004 to present

Industry-leading producer of software for Amazon sellers; long-time eaters of own dogfood.

#### Senior engineer

2019: After years of trying to advocate for a cohesive effort to upgrade our codebase to be Python 3 compatible, and with the January 1st, 2020 deadline less than a year away, decided to just do it. Put together a plan covering our various projects, our out-of-date dependencies, and our several deployment processes, with an emphasis on careful but continual progress. Presented this to my colleagues this summer, integrated their feedback, and finally got widespread buy-in. The project is not quite on track to make the end-of-life deadline but it should wrap up in the first half of 2020.

2018: Integrated FedEx, UPS and USPS APIs into our in-house fulfillment system for automatic flagging of problem shipments needing customer support.

2018: Uncovered a subtle bug in our transaction code that eventually proved to be responsible for the scattered but disturbing cases of "impossible" database state we'd been observing for years. We decided the rate of problems did not yet justify the work that would be involved in safely fixing the problem, but we now know what look out for and and where to go to fix it if it becomes a problem.

2017: Designed and implemented a major new repricing feature for Sellery allowing it to automatically respond to competitor's pricing strategies over time.

2016: Rebuilt the invoicing system for our flagship product, improving reliability and readability and increasing test coverage. In the process, uncovered and fixed several long-standing bugs.

2015: Spent two months trying to merge eight git repositories with partially overlapping file structure while preserving history, commit order, and rewindability. Ultimately we had to sacrifice the last goal, but the end result worked for our purposes and the project was considered a success.

#### Engineering, architecture, database administration

2012-2015: Worked to improve reliability, performance and observability of our flagship product, Sellery. Acted as primary liaison between support team and development team, striving to ensure that the dev team understood customer needs and confusions and the support team understood technical aspects of feature timelines, blockers, and occasional downtime.

2010-2012: Design, architecture and beta phase of Sellery. Worked with core team to architect a new flagship product leveraging our existing codebase. Ultimately this would grow to a scale considerably larger than our own operations.

#### Ops transitioning to software development

2005-2009: Turned a critical business process that relied on a single SQL query taking two to three weeks into a distributed system using a custom-built lightweight database. Over the course of two years, improved this system to the point where it handled over ten times as much work in less than one hundredth the time, while constantly adding new features and adapting to changes in our upstream data sources.

#### Sandwich mastery

2007-present: Built thousands of sandwiches. Enjoyed them.

### Various: 1995-2003

From 1995 to 2003 I worked various tech support and systems and network administration jobs. Feel free to ask me about them :)
