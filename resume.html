Staff Software Engineer - June 2021 to December 2022</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lead engineer of a new team of mostly early-career engineers. Led a
successful project to replace the outdated sales demo system. The new
system was more flexible and allowed sales engineers to demo new product
features and build new demo scenarios independently.</li>
<li>Extended several core ingestion services to enrich incoming
telemetry with resource-based metadata from GCP, AWS, Datadog, and other
sources.</li>
<li>Enhanced the enrichment service with a persistence layer that was
still in use virtually maintenance-free when I left over a year
later.</li>
<li>Helped develop and lead the Backend SIG (Special Interest Group), a
cross-department engineering group dedicated to identifying and driving
initiatives to improve architecture and code quality system-wide.</li>

<ul>
<li>Led engineering analysis and acceptance testing on a tiger team
rebuilding the new-user experience for New Relic One
<code>[1]</code>.</li>
<li>Replaced a critical business process that relied on a single SQL
query which ran for two to three weeks with a distributed system using a
custom-built lightweight ETL pipeline and database.</li>
<li>Thoroughly tested and completely revised the Docker installation
documentation for instrumentation agents for eight programming
languages.</li>
<li>Added configuration file linting support to New Relic Diagnostics
<code>[2]</code>, the support organization’s customer-facing diagnostics
suite.</li>
<li>Integrated New Relic Diagnostics into the New Relic CLI
<code>[3]</code>. This was a long-standing goal of both teams that had
been put on hold due to technical challenges.</li>

Software: Sysadmin, Software Engineer - April 2004 to November 2019</h3>
<p>Industry-leading producer of software for Amazon sellers; long-time
eaters of own dogfood.</p>
<h4 id="lead-engineer-2015---2019">Lead engineer: 2015 - 2019</h4>
<ul>
<li>Designed and initiated a plan for incremental migration to Python 3
of our 10 year old, half-million-line code base, dealing with broad
dependency upgrades first. Negotiated with engineering, support, and
business development teams to achieve buy-in and secure resources,
enabling a timeline all teams could work with.</li>
<li>Integrated FedEx, UPS and USPS APIs into our in-house fulfillment
system for automatic flagging of problem shipments needing customer
support.</li>
<li>While investigating our transaction handling code for possible
refactoring, uncovered a subtle but potentially devastating bug that
eventually proved to be responsible for the scattered but disturbing
cases of “impossible” database state we’d been observing for years.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented a major new repricing feature for our
flagship product, allowing it to automatically respond to competitors’
pricing strategies over time.</li>
<li>Rebuilt the invoicing system for this product, improving reliability
and readability and increasing test coverage. In the process, uncovered
and fixed several long-standing bugs.</li>
<li>Ran a project to merge eight git repositories with partially
overlapping file structure while preserving history and commit
order.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="senior-engineer-2010---2015">Senior engineer: 2010 - 2015</h4>
<ul>
<li>Worked with core team to architect a new flagship product, Sellery,
a highly configurable repricing and inventory management system,
leveraging our existing codebase.</li>
<li>Acted as primary liaison between product and development, ensuring
that the dev team understood customer needs and confusions and the
product team understood technical aspects of feature timelines,
blockers, and necessary downtime.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="system-administrator-and-software-engineer-2004---2009">System
administrator and software engineer: 2004 - 2009</h4>
<ul>
<li>Observed that a critical business cycle took two weeks because of a
monolithic SQL query which was getting slower over time. Took initiative
to replace this with a distributed system using a custom-built
lightweight ETL pipeline and database, shortening the cycle to half a
day.</li>
<li>Over the course of two years, improved the efficiency of this system
by over three orders of magnitude, handling ten times the throughput in
in less than one hundredth the time, while constantly adding new
features and adapting to changes in our upstream data sources.</li>
<li>Managed an ever-growing network of desktop, server and virtual
machines, then hired, trained and managed my replacement for that
role.</li>
